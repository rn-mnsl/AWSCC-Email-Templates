Data analytics is the analysis of the past and present to understand what has happened and why.

And even now, I remember the 5Vs. Since there are data that cannot be processed using traditional data processing applications, the term big data was coined up and it led to the evolution of data science

5Vs
1. Volume: Big data datasets are typically very large, with billions or even trillions of records.
2. Velocity: Big data datasets are often generated in real time, or at a very high speed.
3. Variety: Big data datasets can come from a wide variety of sources, including structured data (e.g., relational databases), unstructured data (e.g., text, images, videos), and semi-structured data (e.g., XML, JSON).
4. Veracity: Big data datasets can be noisy and incomplete, and it can be difficult to ensure the quality of the data.
5. Value: Big data has the potential to provide valuable insights that can help organizations to improve their operations, make better decisions, and develop new products and services.

A great example of this is how we interact with various applications, such as YouTube. YouTube stores a huge amount of big data every time we click on a video, search for a video, or perform other actions. They use this data to understand our interests and improve their recommendation engine.

Big data is a powerful tool that has the potential to revolutionize many industries. However, it is important to note that big data also poses some challenges, such as privacy concerns and the need for new data processing technologies.",Yes,"AWS Textract and AWS Sagemaker

This data-centric approach drives economic value for companies and fosters scientific discoveries. However, it also raises concerns about privacy and security.
